    // A texture atlas means that a bunch of different images are loaded into the same texture.  
    // In many applications, such as games with sprites, the textures are all the same size, so 
    // it is rather easy to make a perfect grid.  TrueType fonts are not so pretty for nice 
    // grids, but when rendered properly they look very nice, so I'm willing to jump through 
    // some hoops when loading them.  The characters in TrueType fonts are not the same size 
    // because each character is designed individually and has its own dimensions.  To load 
    // these into an atlas, I am going to run through all the characters and calculate how much 
    // space will be required to load them side-by-side, but be aware that this row of 
    // characters will be of uneven height (not all characters are the same height) and may run 
    // up against the maximum byte width of a texture.  Then I'll allocate the bytes necessary 
    // for a texture to hold all the character's glyphs, and finally I'll load them all 
    // side-by-side in the same order as when I calculated the required texture size.

    // The GL standard defines a maximum size (in bytes) for textures.  This affects 1D and 2D 
    // textures (I've been told that 3D textures have their own max values).  1D is just a line, 
    // so it only applies to that one dimension.  For 2D textures, the max size applies to both 
    // width and height.  This value is determined by the graphics API.  I checked this program
    // (on 3-29-2016), and at this time OpenGL is telling me that my max texture size is 16384 
    // bytes.  This means that I have 16384 bytes for width and 16384 bytes for height, and I 
    // doubt that I am going to max out either with this FreeType library, although if font size (??font size -> bitmap size??)
    // became enormous I might need to start a second row.  But while the GL standard does not 
    // tell the graphics API an upper limit, it does tell them a lower limit for this max value, 
    // which I believe is 1024 bytes.  That is, OpenGL is free to specify that a maximum texture 
    // size is 16kb, or 32kb, or whatever, but the max texture size must not be below 1024 
    // bytes, which should be sufficient to support rather old video or just incapable video 
    // hardware.  A max size of 1024 bytes means that a 2D texture can be, at minimum, 1024x1024 
    // bytes.

    // http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-base_interface.html#FT_LOAD_RENDER
    // Also Also Note: The default render mode loads an 8-bit greyscale bitmap with 256 levels 
    // of opacity (2^8) (implicitly, this means 256 levels of opacity per pixel).  "Use linear 
    // alpha blending and gamma correction to correctly render non-monochrome glyph bitmaps onto

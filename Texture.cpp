// I have decided that I will create a 2D texture of RGBA values.  The fragment shader's idea 
// of color is 0.0-1.0, so I will make each color channel (R, G, B, or alpha) as a float.  Other 
// format options are available if someone wants to get very specific about how they store 
// their texture data (ex: GL_RGBA32F is RGBA (RGB + alpha channel) with 32bits per channel,
// which might come in handy if the programmer was concerned that a user's "float" might not
// be 32bits), but for this demo, I will keep things relatively simple.

Description:
    Encapsulates the generation of texture values so that the CreateTexture() function can focus 
    on the OpenGL texture info.

    Creates three horizontal beams of random color (think of a three-stripe flag).  These are
    sufficient for a barebones demo.
Parameters: 
    putDataHere     Self-explanatory.  Is a pointer because that is my style of indicating 
                    "will be changed".
    maxTexelRows    Self-explanatory.
    texelsPerRow    A texture is a rectangle, and I thought this was more descriptive than 
                    "columns".
Returns:    None
Exception:  Safe

Description:
    Encapsulates the creation of a texture (not the texture parameters; 
    see CreateGenericSampler()).  
    
    These are the basics:
    - Generate a texture ID
    - Binds it (the active texture unit is irrelevant here; whatever texture unit is current set 
        gets run over by this binding, butthe association of a texture unit with a texture is a 
        render time thing, so don't worry about the run over)
    - Generate the data for a 2D texture (in this case, three random color horizontal bars)
    - Load the data into the texture object buffer for the texture ID
    - Returns that texture ID.

    Note: There are two options for telling OpenGL the texture parameters:
    (1) Bind a texture with glBindTexture(...) and using glTexParameteri(...).  This tells OpenGL
    to use those texture parameters for whatever texture is in use.
    (2) Create a texture sampler, use glSamplerParameteri(...), and then associate a texture and 
    texture sampler with the same texture unit at draw time.  

    This tutorial uses the latter approach.  Approach (1) needs to be set whenever the currently
    bound texture needs a different setup than the texture that came before it.  Approach (2) is
    decoupled from the texture itself, hence there is no need to associate it syntactically with
    the texture or textures that it refers to.  
    
    In this way, texture samplers are unlike VAOs, whose vertex array attributes are associated 
    with whatever array buffer ID was bound at the time that those attributes were set up.  While
    maybe seeming like a bit of a hassle, this is the only way that multiple textures with 
    different parameters can be used at the same time.
    
Parameters: None
Returns:
    The OpenGL ID of the texture that was created.

    A sampler is an encapsulation of texture parameters such that glTexParameteri(...), which

    bound texture unit changes.
